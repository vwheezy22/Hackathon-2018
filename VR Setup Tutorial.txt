This tutorial will help you to create a VR Unity project for an Android device.

What you'll need:
     -Unity 5.6 (or higher) with Android SDK installed
     -Java Development Kit installed (www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
     -Android Studio installer downloaded (developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads)
     -Google VR unity package downloaded (developers.google.com/vr/unity/download)
     -Android phone with a reasonably sized screen and gyroscope sensor (most high-end smartphones have that)

1) Android Studio Setup:
     -Go through the installer with all default settings (install will take about 10 min)
     -Choose to launch Studio after this is finished
     -Start a new project (It doesn't matter, just click through so you can get to the Studio home screen)
     -Go to Tools>Android>SDK Manager
     -Make sure that the SDK Platform installed corresponds to your phone's version of Android
     -Copy "Android SDK Location" address to clipboard (this will be useful later)

2) Project Setup:
     -Create a New Project in Unity
     -Go to File>Build Settings and click Android, then hit the "Switch Platform" button
     -Hit "Player Settings" next to that, scroll down, and click on "Other Settings"
     -In Other Settings, enable the "Virtual Reality Supported" checkbox and add the Cardboard SDK by hitting the plus sign, 
         scroll down and change "Package Name" to the format of com.yourname.projectname, and set "Minimum API Level" to Android 5.0
     -Go to Edit>Preferences>External Tools and assign the JDK path there to where you installed your Java Development Kit 
         (will look something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_131)
     -Assign the SDK Path to the address that was copied back in Android Studio Setup
     -Import Google VR package (Unity "Prototyping" package could also be useful for game development later)
     -In Assets, go to Google VR>Scenes and open a demo scene

3) Phone Setup:
     -Go to the Play Store and install the Google Cardboard app
     -Open your Android phone's settings and enable Developer Mode by going to "About Device", scrolling down, and tapping the Build Number 7 times
     -Now "Developer Options" have been unlocked below "About Device"; go there and enable USB Debugging
     -On your computer, go to Android Studio and hit Tools>Android Device Monitor
     -In this "Monitor" application you can see what the game is doing on the phone by going down to the LogCat window and filtering with "tag:Unity"

Now if you build & run the Unity project, the VR demo should appear on your phone and you can debug your project in real time on the phone by using LogCat!
